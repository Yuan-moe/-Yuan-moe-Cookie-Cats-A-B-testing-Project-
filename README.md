# -Yuan-moe-Cookie-Cats-A-B-testing-Project-
This is a project that I create to practice my data analysis skills, in which I try to address the problem of this game whether to move its in-app-purchase gate from the level_30 to level_40.
In this project, I mainly use the customer retaintion rate as the metrix to evaluate the gate place performance. 
This project is guided by @ DataCamp.com
